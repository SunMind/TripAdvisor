# Trip Advisor restful application with a purpose to get a list of items needed for any kind of trip 


Spring Boot H2 Database CRUD: Building Rest API with Spring Data JPA.

Used technologies such as:
- Spring Boot v3
- H2 database
- Spring Data JPA
- Swagger (Open API)

- To start this application you should clone project from here -> https://github.com/SunMind/TripAdvisor.git 
- Then import it in your used IDE as a maven project.
- First start application without data.sql (Because in a first cycle tables will be created from entities).
- Then start application again with data.sql to fill up tables with data.

- Use http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html for api testing
- Use http://localhost:8080/h2-ui/ for H2 db interface
